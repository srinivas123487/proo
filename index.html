    <h2>PROFILE</h2>
    <p>
      I am a motivated third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I have hands-on experience in developing innovative projects that bridge the gap between technology and real-world needs. One of my notable projects is an AI-powered virtual try-on system for clothing, enabling users to preview outfits digitally before purchasing. I also contributed to the development of a smart vehicle monitoring and alert system that detects high temperatures and sends real-time safety notifications. Currently, I am focused on advancing my web development skills to create responsive and interactive applications. I am deeply passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address real-life challenges and am committed to continuous learning in AI and software development.
